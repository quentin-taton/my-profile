						<h1> Hello, I'm Quentin </h1>

								<p class="text-center">

					<h2>Who am I?</h2>
						<p class="text-center">I am a very honest and genuine person. I tend to speak my mind and am opened to all kinds of opinions. Having lived in a variety of countries worldwide, my ability to understand different cultures has expended tremendously. My interests revolve around basketball and reading. When it comes to work, I get easily motivated if the subject in question peeks my interest and curiosity. I have ease with Mathematics and Finance because it has both a very concrete base but can go to abstract lengths to stimulate intellect. </p>

					<h2>Reading & Music</h2>
						<p class="text-center"> Ever since my childhood, literature has played a big role in my life as it has helped me see things from different perspectives as literature can easily mesh with issues that still are common today. My favorite books are Farenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury and Ubik by Philip K Dick. Music is also a big influence in my life. My favorite genre is Rap music, I listen to both french and english hip-hop and I believe music is a great way to express one's self.</p>

				<div class="card-white">
					<h2>Basketball</h2>
						<p class="text-center">When I was younger, I used to be in the National League of Basketball in Singapore for U18 and I was point guard which can be caracterised as the floor general. I was able to partake in a National League title run during back to back seasons and during my last year took on the role of captain and unfortunately lost in the big game. I am also a big fan of the NBA and my favorite team is the Houston Rockets. </p>
